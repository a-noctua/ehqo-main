This page will largely be a work-in-progress for some time while I continue to build out my site. 

For now, here's a few ~fun facts~ about me:

- I'm a techno-generalist (meaning I'm not particularly good at any particular thing) with a wide array of interests and hobbies, such as furniture restoration
- I'm completely obsessed with my dog, who is a small but sometimes big, black labrador mix
- By trade, I work in [REDACTED], where I do my best to safeguard people and things
- I have many goals for 2024 - one of them is reading and writing more
- My handle is prounced like the word echo - /ˈek.oʊ/
