This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), a place for little projects and ideas that might turn into something bigger, or might not. 

Many of the posts here started on one of my [Scribbles](https://scribbles.page) blogs. Each time one is posted, it is cross-posted and archived here via [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app). If you would like to follow along, please subscribe to the particular feed you are interested in on Scribbles as these are separate from my main blog on this site.
