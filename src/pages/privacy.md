I respect the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and this policy document explains how I collect and handle any information you provide to me.

**How do I use the data you provide?**
This website collects fully anonymous visitor statistics via an open source analytics platform called [Umami](https://umami.is/). Umami is open source, GDPR & CCPA compliant, and does not utilize cookies. All data is anonymized and no personal data is ever collected. I have no interest in knowing any of your personal information.

**How secure is your data?**
Very secure, see below. 

**How secure is this website?**
This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the server. Your network provider can still see that you are downloading assets from this site, but not its content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data, for example, while browsing on public WiFi, or from network providers injecting advertisements on this site. All relevant response HTTP headers are set for your protection and the Content Security Policy is adjusted to this websites requirements.

**Changes to the policy**
If I change the content of this policy, those changes will be effective at the time I post them here.

**Complaints**
If you have any reason to complain about the way I handle your privacy, please contact me by email: <a href="mailto:{{ personal.email }}">{{ personal.email }}</a>.
