## An Eleventy starter

This starter is based on [Andy Bell's CSS workflow/boilerplate](/about/).
In Andy's words, we'd rather hint the browser than micromanage it, using progressive enhancement, CSS layout, fluid type & spacing, and modern CSS features.
The aim is to create frontends that look good to everyone, regardless of device, connection speed or context.

Everything else is my own defaults and opinions and my preferred organization system for Eleventy projects. I have tried to [document a few things](/get-started/).

**Have fun** and let me know if you find any issues or have ideas for improvements!
