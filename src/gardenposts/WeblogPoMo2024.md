Hello Internet! Welcome to the starting line of WeblogPoMo2024! [Rev up those keyboards](https://monkeytype.com/) and get those typing-fingers ready, because the race to make a blog post every day for the entirety of May is about to begin. [Annie](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/), official/unofficial CEO of Weblog.lol, came up with the concept for [WeblogPoMo 2024](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024) after being inspired by other communities' month-long writing challenges.  
  
There's a [growing list](https://weblog.anniegreens.lol/weblog-posting-month-2024/participators) of awesome folks participating in WeblogPoMo, and I highly recommend following along as we all take part in this challenge. Some have chosen pre-defined topics or themes for their posts, such as [Keenan](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/weblogpomo2024) who will be writing about 31 songs that are meaningful to them.   
  
Because I am a person in need of some sort of structure, I've decided to follow Keenan's lead and give myself a theme in hopes that it will keep me motivated and on track for all of May. I will be documenting my decade-long journey as *The Hobby Collector*. Since an early age I have never stuck to just one interest, and so I will be exploring my past endeavors ranging from landscape design and EDC gear to home automation and stained glass work.
